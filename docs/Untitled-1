Hi I'm Conor McGrath a Computer Whisperer & Software Developer from Dublin Ireland.
From a young age I was always interested in understanding how computers worked, after many iterations of
breaking & fixing, my knowledge & curiosity grew.
Then when it came time for college, I knew what I wanted to do.

I've been working in the industry now for 3 years, on a variety of dfifernt projects & technolgy stacks.
Since graduating with a 2.1 from Information Systems, i've been contionously learning & upskilling
in C#, Angular, Azure & DevOps. This has helped me take on a wide range or roles and help across
the board from Development to Testing & delivery.

This site primary exists to document my journey as a developer,
show potential employers what I'm all about & host some interesting projects!

Since Graduating with a 2.1 in Information Systems I landed my first 'real' job in an IT consulting
firm based here in Dublin. I had the opportunity to travel & work on some really interesteding projects
and get exposure to many different technolgy stacks. I've been continiously learning & upskilling
in C#, Angular, Azure & DevOps. This has enabled me work across the board from Development, DevOps & QA.

me to computing, I haven't looked back since.
